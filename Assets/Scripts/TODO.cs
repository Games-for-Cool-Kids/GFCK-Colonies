/*
 * To Do:
 * - Account for center of selected object when dragging it, so it only jumps up. Now it seems to go to the point of raycast hit. Should only go up.
 * - Smooth dragging. Move towards mouse instead of being on top of mouse.
 * - Highlight object that hand hovers
 * - Have both options to toss object into stockpile or to release mouse on top of stockpile. Toss because it's fun, on mouse release to avoid object being stuck.
