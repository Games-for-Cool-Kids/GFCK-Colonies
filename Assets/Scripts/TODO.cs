/*
 * To Do:
 * - Hold mouse to drag instead of click to select and click to release.
 * - Account for center of selected object when dragging it, so it only jumps up. Now it seems to go to the point of raycast hit. Should only go up.
 * - Smooth dragging. Move towards mouse instead of being on top of mouse.
